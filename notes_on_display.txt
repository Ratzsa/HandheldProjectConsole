The 1.3" display is SH1106.
The 0.96" display is SSD1306.
The library is good for both.
For SH1106, set
#define SSD1306_Width 128
(ssd1306.h line 111) to
#define SSD1306_Width 132

Resolution seems to only be 128x64.
The SH1106 has an internal RAM of 132x64 but that does not translate to an actual screen size of 132x64.

Coordinate ranges:
X: 2 - 129 (weird)
Y: 0 - 63 (as it should be)

This means any coordinate system that covers the entire width of the screen MUST be uint16_t or larger!
